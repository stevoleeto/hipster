#Description
This web application allows user's to coordinate their personal schedule with the schedules of group's they have created or have been invited to. A user's profile centers around their personal schedule as well as the groups they are a part of. Once a group is created, that group will show the free times of all members assocated with that group. Additionally, the group becomes its own entity with its own schedule of events! User's can then pull the group events down to their personal schedule at will. 
You can also link your google calendar to your personal schedule! Try it out.
